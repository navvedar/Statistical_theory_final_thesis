# COVID-19 Analysis: Impact of Early vs. Delayed Interventions

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for analyzing the impact of early vs. delayed public health interventions on the spread of COVID-19. The analysis compares confirmed case numbers between countries with early and delayed interventions using statistical methods. It aims to determine whether earlier interventions (such as lockdowns, social distancing, etc.) helped reduce the spread of the virus.

## Files
- **`theorical sattistic navve darchi.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing all the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **`covid_data.csv`**: Dataset used for the analysis, which includes confirmed COVID-19 case data from various countries.
- **Graphs and Visualizations**:
  - **`early_intervention_cases.png`**: Bar chart showing confirmed cases in early-intervention countries.
  - **`delayed_intervention_cases.png`**: Bar chart showing confirmed cases in delayed-intervention countries.
  - **`boxplot_confirmed_cases.png`**: Boxplot comparing confirmed cases between early and delayed intervention countries.
  - **`confidence_interval_cases.png`**: Plot showing the confidence intervals for confirmed cases.
  - **`qqplot_early_intervention.png`**: Q-Q plot for early-intervention countries.
  - **`qqplot_delayed_intervention.png`**: Q-Q plot for delayed-intervention countries.

## Project Description
The analysis uses real-world data to understand the effect of public health interventions on the COVID-19 spread. Countries were categorized into two groups based on their intervention timing:
- **Early Intervention Countries**: Countries that implemented public health measures (such as lockdowns) within two weeks of the first reported case.
- **Delayed Intervention Countries**: Countries that took more than two weeks to implement significant public health measures.

The analysis employs statistical hypothesis testing (such as t-tests) and creates various visualizations to compare the groups.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Clone the repository
To run the analysis, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-19-analysis.git
cd covid-19-analysis
```

### 2. Install the required packages
Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. You can do this by using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The file contains the following required packages:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations
- `scipy`: For statistical functions
- `seaborn`: For enhanced visualizations

### 3. Run the Jupyter notebook
After the packages are installed, you can open and run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook covid_analysis.ipynb
```

This command will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. From there:
1. Open the file `covid_analysis.ipynb`.
2. Run each cell in the notebook to generate the analysis and visualizations.

### 4. View the Results
The notebook contains all the code to generate:
- Bar charts comparing confirmed cases between early and delayed intervention countries.
- A boxplot comparing the distributions of confirmed cases.
- Confidence intervals to estimate the true mean of confirmed cases for each group.
- Q-Q plots to assess the normality of the distributions.

## Data Description
The dataset (`covid_data.csv`) includes the following columns:
- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Confirmed Cases**: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country.
- **Intervention Type**: Whether the country implemented early or delayed interventions.

The dataset helps in categorizing countries and understanding how intervention timing impacted the spread of COVID-19.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Hypothesis Testing
The analysis tests the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases between early and delayed intervention countries.
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in confirmed COVID-19 cases between the two groups.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a significant difference in confirmed COVID-19 cases between the two groups.

### 2. Confidence Intervals
We calculate 95% confidence intervals to estimate the average number of confirmed cases for each group.

### 3. Visualizations
We use various visualizations to illustrate the results:
- Bar charts for case comparisons.
- Boxplots to show the spread of data.
- Q-Q plots to check for normality in each group.

## Known Issues and Limitations
1. **Data Accuracy**: The analysis relies on publicly available data, which may include inaccuracies or underreporting.
2. **Additional Factors**: This analysis does not account for factors like healthcare infrastructure, population density, and testing rates, which could influence the results.
3. **Future Research**: Future analyses could include these additional variables and explore the long-term impact on mortality rates and economic effects.
